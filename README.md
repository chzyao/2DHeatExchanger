# 2DHeatExchanger

This repository contains my coursework source code and results for Computational Fluid Dynamics Module, taken in my third year, Autumn 2022. 

This coursework solves the Compressible Navier-Stokes Equation with a Conservative Formulation using Finite Difference Schemes spatially, and 2nd-order Adams-Bashforth and 3rd-order Runge-Kutta for time integrations. Vorticity fields are visualised with 'plot_py' and 'plot_gnu'. Although the title of the coursework is called "Direct Numerical Simulation of a 2D Heat Exchanger Based on Circular Cylinders," there is no actual heat exchange process in this coursework as the cylinders are not heated to be the heat source. Programming Language is Fortran. 


(The executable shouldn't be included in the repository though...)
